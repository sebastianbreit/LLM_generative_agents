    "Sarah:  I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children\\n\n",
    "Laurie: I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.\\n\n",
    "Christie: You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.\\n\n",
    "Sarah: There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.\\n\n",

    "Laurie: There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.\\n\n",
